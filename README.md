Bespoke functionality for a multi-language WordPress website

The files uploaded to this repository contain code to offer solutions to these problems:

•	A requirement to allow a custom modal (pop-up) to launch either in page content or in the menu. This had to integrate with a Main Modal that is fully editable with WPBakery as a VC element.

•	A requirement to style modal video image triggers. This allowed the company to style up the look and feel of the clickable images without needing to interact with the modal functionality directly. This was a particular challenge as different page templates display these images differently.

•	The company needed to create various different sliders to integrate different styled sliders with WPBakery. An examples can be seen here: https://uk.exciteosa.com/how-exciteosa-can-help/. 

•	Another requirement was for a scroll activated sticky top navigation bar, this had to allow for changes in style and state between different scroll positions. This included a change in swatch and swapping logo images.

•	The company needed to declare custom page templates for different styling and functionality. The client needed different templates for the HCP section of the website as well as templates to pull different CSS styles. Also needed were combinations of the two template types.
